# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).





# Important
First of all install the dependencies:
1.npm install
2 npm install -g json-server


Starting the Application:

1.Start React Development Server
npm start
2.Start the JSON Server:  (make sure it is running on port 8000)
json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

NOTE:Port JSON server 8000 keeps it separate from your React app (3000)

Test Credentials for Admin:
Username: adminuser
Password: admin123
-(Full access to all routes and features)


Test Credentials for User:
Username: user
Password: user123
-(Limited access)


Key Features to Test:

-User friendly UI for Vrv Security (make sure logged in as Admin or User)
Login functionality
Protected route access
Roled based control over protected routes 
-Admin
-User
Session persistence
Logout functionality
-Functionallity of create ,read ,update and delete operations of customers 
-Used JSON server for data storage 
Implementation of JWT authentication  for secure access.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.





### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
